// //Write a Javascript program that checks if a given number, number is odd or even. 

// If the number is odd, print to the console: number is odd. If  the number is even, print to the console: number is even 

// Hint: An even number is divisible by 2. Hence, for an even number, the expression, 

// number % 2 === 0 will evaluate to true


const number = 5

if (number % 2 === 0){
    console.log("This is an even number!")
}
else{
    console.log("This is an odd number!")
